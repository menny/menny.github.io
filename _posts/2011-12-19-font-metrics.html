<p>I'm working on a new feature for <a href="https://market.android.com/details?id=com.menny.android.anysoftkeyboard" title="" target="_blank">AnySoftKeyboard</a>,&nbsp;where it will 'hint' the user about what lays behind long-pressing a key.</p>

<p>I've decided that the best UX I can provide, is to draw a small character, at the bottom-right corner of the key, showing the long-press output, or "..." in case there are lots of them. It will probably look like this:<br/>

</p>

<p>So, I had to figure out how to position the character there. Java/Android provides a nice service called <a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/graphics/Paint.FontMetrics.html" title="" target="_blank">FontMetrics</a>, which provide general metrics on the font, 
like what is the tallest glyph (character), lowest glyph, etc.</p>

<p>Since the hint is very small, I had to make sure the position is precised. So I've dived into the definitions of those metrics, 
and their values, and cooked up a small <a href="https://github.com/menny/FontMetrics-Visualization/downloads" title="" target="_blank">Android app</a> which
visualizing the metrics, and since an image is worth 37.5 tweets, I give you a screenshot:<br/>

</p>
<p>Here is FontMetrics in layman lingo:
<ul>
  <li><u>baseline:</u>&nbsp;the base of your font drawing. Your text will be drawn ABOVE this X.</li>
  <li><u>top:</u>&nbsp;the maximum distance above the baseline for the tallest glyph. Since it is ABOVE the baseline, it is a negative value!</li>
  <li><u>ascent:</u>&nbsp;this is the recommended space above the baseline you should make for a line of this text. Again, above the baseline, so negative.</li>
  <li><u>descent:</u>&nbsp;this is the recommended space below the baseline you should keep for text, since some characters (e.g, y) are drawn some below the baseline.</li>
  <li><u>bottom:</u>&nbsp;this is the lowest glyph space below the baseline.</li>
  <li><u>leading:</u> I haven't included that in the image (or the app) since it is usually 0. But, to make the post complete, <i>leading</i> is the recommended extra space to add between two line of text. I think that the reason that it is usually defined as none, is because <i>bottom</i> (or <i>top</i>) takes care of the extra space needed.</li>
</ul>
