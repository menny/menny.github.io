<p>We release <a href="http://www.speakingpal.com">our software</a> in a few days. And in the last cycle of tests, all kind of bugs are surfacing up. And we are tight, <i>real tight</i> - our release date was two weeks ago.</p>

<p>No time to fix bugs, no time to switch to a different technology, no time to re-design classes: we need to ship the software! <a href="http://thebabyboomerentrepreneur.com/1202/seth-godin-says-real-artists-ship-do-you/">Like real artists</a>.</p>
<p>So, I hacked network code to make a <a href="http://code.google.com/p/ksoap2-android/issues/detail?id=35">3rd party code work properly</a>, I kept unrelated code in classes just so their inheriting classes could use it, I <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaghetti_code">'Spaghetti-ed'</a> the hell out of my code just to quickly implement a requirement.</p>
<p>All-in-all, <strong>I've been a bad boy</strong>. But sometimes a software developer has to be. I'm not proud of it, but if we want to release, we need to make it work.</p>
