` Welcome to WordPress. This is your first post. Edit or delete it, then start blogging! `

The text above (and post title) is an automatic post done by [WordPress](http://wordpress.org) installation (the blogs application used in this site). I find it nice, as a programmer I mean: The first thing you learn in every programming language tutorial is how to create an ["Hello world!" program](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hello_world_program) (whether it teaches anything is questionable, especially in the [smartphones area](http://symbian.compactbyte.com/2004/06/hello-world.html) which requires way too many _satellite_ files just to get started).
Ok, to the point, Iâ€™m going to use this blog to share my experiences at [my day job](http://www.speakingpal.com/), my [hobby](http://softkeyboard.googlecode.com), [side projects](http://code.google.com/p/fill-mythvideo-metadata), and to talk about solutions I find for all kind of computer related stuff (e.g. how to configure a decent [MythTV machine](http://mythtv.org/wiki/user:Menny)), and possibly things I think are cool (in a _geeky_ kinda way).
