API brakage is a painful thing for developers, and [Robolectric](https://robolectric.org) sure did that with v3!
In most cases, I find the new API and structure 
Let's start with times:
 * starting an emulator: _2 minutes_
 * installing an APK and the test APK: _30 seconds_
 * Running one instrumental test: _5-20 seconds_
 * A medium project will have **60** of those: _12.5 minutes_
 * Running lint: _30 seconds_
 * Running Robolectric tests: _40 seconds_.
Adds up to about 16 minutes. Some projects are smaller, most respected codebase are larger.
 * Letting something else run those test: _timeless_!
